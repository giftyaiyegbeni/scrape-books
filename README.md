Developed web scraping scripts to automate the extraction of book details from a website
In this project, I crafted specialized web scraping scripts to gather valuable information from multiple online sources. 

Firstly, I designed a script to scrape book data from the http://books.toscrape.com website. This script systematically collected details such as book name, price, stock availability, rating, description, product information, and category. It was optimized to traverse through the first 5 pages, scraping a total of 100 books (20 books per page).

Next, I developed a separate script to extract information about quote authors from http://quotes.toscrape.com. This involved retrieving data like the author's name, nationality, description, and date of birth. The script was set up to obtain details of 10-20 distinct quote authors, ensuring a diverse range of information.

Additionally, I created a versatile scraper capable of extracting content from random pages on Wikipedia, demonstrating a broader application of web scraping techniques. This functionality allows for the dynamic extraction of various types of data from Wikipedia, depending on the specific requirements of the user.

In summary, this project involved the creation of custom web scraping tools tailored to the unique structures of different websites. The scripts successfully collected extensive and diverse data, showcasing the capability to extract structured information from web sources efficiently and reliably.
